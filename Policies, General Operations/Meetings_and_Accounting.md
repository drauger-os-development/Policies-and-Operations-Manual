# Meetings

Meetings will occur on a quarterly basis in a way that promotes engagement from the CCT, but also lowers friction from trying to schedule everyone to meet at the same time.  Towards that end, meetings will be planned to start at a certain date and time, but will be conducted in a non-real-time manner via Discord chat.  Members will plan to be engaged to the max extent possible, but realize that people's responses will not be real-time.

Meetings will begin at 5:00 PM CST on the 15th of January, April, July, and October.  Changes go into effect 5 days after the meeting is adjourned.

##### Meeting agenda
The basic meeting agenda will be as follows
1. Bringing the meeting to order (with roll call)
2. Nominations and voting on leadership positions
3. Updates and plans from leadership team
	- discussion should show some progress and planning on leadership responsibilities
4. New proposals and action items
	- after initial discussion, separate threads should be created
5. Community focum

##### Proposals

Proposals changing the Policies and Operations Manual will be made through a pull request in Github.

An action item is a proposal that is not intended to be a permanent addition to the Policies and Operations Manual, but rather actions to be taken by an individual or group.

Any action items should have a person assigned to it and an expected finish date set.  The purpose of this requirement is so it is clear who is working on it and when we can expect it to be finished (or at least an update).

All proceedings in threads will follow the guidelines of the standard protocol section.

# Finances

##### Summary

The finances of the project should be handled by the CCT and be transparent to the community.  Basic accounting concepts will be employed and at a minimum include double entry and cash basis accounting.

##### Treasurer

The Treasurer is in charge of tracking and reporting Drauger OS finances.  See the CCT membership document for more details.  The Treasurer will be familiar with basic concepts of accounting.

##### Spending

The CCT team is in charge of determining spending priorities.  This will be accomplished by enacting policies/action items per the meeting section of the Policies and Operations Manual.  The Treasurer will not make purchases to ensure separation of duties.

##### Continuity

Accounting documentation should be stored in a location agreed upon by the CCT members and amended to this paragraph.  That location should be accessible by the CPM and ACPM and will be backed up.

In that same location, the Treasurer will collect continuity documents that explain current accounting operations and basic accounting principles for the time when another takes his place as Treasurer.

##### Transparency

The community should know what contributions to the project are being spent on and should be reassured that contributions are not being embezzled by project members.  Towards that end, quarterly reports will be made available to the community.  The quarterly reporting periods are:
- January through March
- April through June
- July through September
- October through December.
The reports are due by the end of the month following the quarterly reporting period.  Annual reports are due by the end of January.

Reports will be stored with the accounting documentation and posted in the news channel in Discord and on Telegram.
