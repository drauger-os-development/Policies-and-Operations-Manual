# CCT Membership

## Joining
Any member who occupies a project leadership position as defined in this document in this folder will be part of the CCT.  These policies pair the member's leadership position with their position on the CCT.  While the duties of each are different, losing one position will result in the loss of the other (exception: with a member who has multiple leadership position, the loss of one leadership position does not result in their removal from the CCT)

##### Nomination
If a leadership position is vacant, at the next meeting new members will be nominated by a member of the CCT and seconded.  Once all nominations are collected, a member shall propose a vote which will be seconded.  If there is only one nomination, the person nominated will assume the position.  If there are multiple people nominated, the person who receives the most votes will assume the position.

In January of each year, all leadership positions will be nominated and voted for by the current CCT team.

## Leaving
There is one way in which a Contributor can voluntarily leave the CCT.

1. **Resignation**

	Any Contributor on the CCT may voluntarily resign from their position. No reason has to be given (although it is strongly recommended), and the CCT must acknowledge the Contributor's resignation. Rejections of resignations are strictly disallowed.

## Maintaining Membership
Maintaining Membership of the CCT requires Contributors to follow the below points.

* **Remain Active**
	CCT membership is tied to their leadership position.  CCT members are expected to actively manage their responsibilities, push information to the CPM or ACPM, and attend meetings.

	Any Contributor who does not respond to messages within a 2 week period will become inactive.  When contributors, CPM, or ACPM identify a member who is not responding, they will bring it to the attention of the CCT members in the cct-text channel.  If the inactivity is verified by the CCT, that member will become an inactive CCT member.  The final deciding authority is the CPM, followed by the ACPM.  This does not apply to members who have arranged, in advance, to be away for a period of time.

	Inactive CCT members have no CCT rights or authority.  Inactive CCT members can become active by vote of the CCT.  Members who have become an inactive CCT member for one month without contacting the CCT will be removed as a contributor.

* **Uphold the Community Guidelines and Contributor Posting Policy, and CCT Code of Conduct**

	If a Contributor violates either the Community Guidelines, Contributor Posting Policy, or CCT Code of Conduct, feedback and corrective action will be used to the max extent possible.  The priority is in correcting the behavior so the member can continue to serve.
	
	If the member continues to violate the guidelines and policies above, or if the first infraction is severe enough, the CCT, or (if Executive Action has been invoked) the CPM, may revoke a Contributor's membership in the CCT.
	
	Determination of the necessity of this course of action, based on the severity of the infraction, falls upon either the CCT, or (if Executive Action has been invoked) the CPM.

* **Remain in otherwise good standing with the Drauger OS Community and the other Contributors**

	All Contributors in the CCT must be viewed favorably by the Drauger OS Community. If the Drauger OS Community or the Contributor Community demands the removal of a Contributor from the CCT, then the will of the people must be followed.
	
	In this instance, Standard Protocol should be followed, and the Contributor in question does not have the right to participate in these proceedings (but they may spectate), unless invited to participate and the invitation is approved by the CPM or ACPM. This invitation _DOES NOT_ extend voting rights to the Contributor in question.
	

## Leadership positions
The following are the only leadership positions that results in membership of the CCT and their responsibilities.  Major decisions, especially in regards to appointing or removing delegated responsibilities (moderators for example) will still be voted upon by the CCT.  All leadership positions except the CPM and ACPM can have subordinates delegated in writing per the delegation of duties document.  Up to two subordinate contributors can be designated as deputies (example: Deputy Secretary, Deputy Director of Advancement) and those deputies will also be CCT members.
